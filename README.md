# Fabricate Diem

An app for designing clothing patterns using a 3D model.

Goals:

* Make it easy to share/fork/favorite designs.
* Make it possible to design for any size/shape person.
* To that end, everything should be configurable: you should be able to add your
  own models (as well as changing the dimensions of existing models) and
  fabrics, as well as creating the clothing itself.

## Install

Right now there is no backend component. You can try out the frontend by running
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the _webapp/static_ directory and pointing a
browser at _index.html_.
